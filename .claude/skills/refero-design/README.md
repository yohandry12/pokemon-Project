# Refero Skill

An agent skill that makes design research mandatory before implementation: styles-first visual research, real-screen pattern research, flow reasoning, reference locks, optional visual exploration, post-build QA, and craft guidance. When Refero MCP is available, it can use curated visual styles, 150,000+ real app screens, and 6,000+ user flows from Stripe, Linear, Notion, Figma, and the best-designed products ever built.

## Install

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Lovable, and any MCP-compatible agent.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/referodesign/refero_skill --skill refero-design
```

Craft knowledge loads immediately. No account required.

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/referodesign/refero_skill.git ~/.claude/skills/refero-design
```

On Claude.ai, add the contents of `SKILL.md` to your project knowledge.

## What it does

1. **Researches styles, screens, and flows** — starts with visual styles for taste and direction, then uses real screens and user flows for product patterns and journey logic when live Refero MCP tools are available.
2. **Extracts patterns** — identifies specific design decisions and builds a reference list before touching code.
3. **Routes the workflow** — goes directly to code for clear edits, or creates three reference-locked directions when exploration is valuable.
4. **Applies craft knowledge** — uses built-in guides on typography, color, spacing, motion, icons, and copywriting. Flags anti-slop patterns before they appear.
5. **Designs and validates with evidence** — every decision traces back to a real product or a craft rule, and substantial visual work gets checked against the locked target before handoff.

## Connect live design research

Set up Refero MCP from [refero.design/mcp](https://refero.design/mcp), then connect your tool:

<details>
<summary>Claude Code</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http refero https://api.refero.design/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cursor</summary>

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "refero": {
      "url": "https://api.refero.design/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Gemini CLI</summary>

```bash
gemini mcp add --transport http refero https://api.refero.design/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lovable</summary>

Settings → Connectors → New MCP server → `https://api.refero.design/mcp` → Bearer token

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other tools</summary>

```
URL: https://api.refero.design/mcp
Auth: Bearer <token>
```

</details>

The first time you call Refero, a browser window opens to sign in. After that it's automatic.
